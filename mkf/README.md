Common Makefile for remerge Go projects. Various targets are provided:

*TBD: update while working on: https://trello.com/c/vROA2Va8/115-improve-and-share-makefilecommon-revivetoml-between-go-services*

## Setup

Add this repository as a subtree to the go project repository.

```
git remote add makefile https://github.com/remerge/go-makefile.git
git subtree add --prefix mkf/ makefile master
```

Afterwards `mkf/Makefile.common` can be included in the parent project.

## Example

```
PROJECT := go-tools
PACKAGE := github.com/remerge/$(PROJECT)
REVIVELINTER_EXCLUDES = $(foreach p,$(wildcard **/*_fsm.go),-exclude $(p))

include mkf/Makefile.common
```
